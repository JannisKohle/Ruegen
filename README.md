I've always wanted to create my own programming language - so I did:

This is R端gen, a object oriented programming language, made in Python.

R端gen is very similar to Python, but there are a few features that don't

exist in Python or are very differnt.

Some things which are different in R端gen:

1: '<', '>', '==', 'and', 'is' and 'or' expressions:
   In R端gen, every expression like this is sorrounded by '(' and ')'.
   Example: ( (a < b) and ( (c > d) or (e == f) ) )
   This makes it easier to work with many expressions (like in the example).
   This feature also exists in Python, but there you don't NEED brackets.
   In my language you MUST USE brackets, just because that's easier for me to implement.
