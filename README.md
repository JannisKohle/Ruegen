I've always wanted to create my own programming language - so I did:

This is Rügen, a object oriented programming language, made in Python.

Rügen is very similar to Python, but there are a few features that don't

exist in Python or are very differnt.

Some things which are different in Rügen:

1: '<', '>', '==', 'and', 'is' and 'or' expressions:
   In Rügen, every expression like this is sorrounded by '(' and ')'.
   Example: ( (a < b) and ( (c > d) or (e == f) ) )
   This makes it easier to work with many expressions (like in the example).
   This feature also exists in Python, but there you don't NEED brackets.
   In my language you MUST USE brackets, just because that's easier for me to implement.


If you want to try out rügen, do the following steps: (This is not working yet, it's just what I want it to be when it's done)

1: Install git and python if you haven't already

2: Clone this Repo into the directory you want to use Rügen in:
   ```git clone github.com/JannisKohle/Rügen
```
3: Create a .txt file and write code a Rügen program in it (tutorials on rügen-language.tech)

4: To run your program, use the Rügen command in the Terminal:
   ```rügen [filename]
```
